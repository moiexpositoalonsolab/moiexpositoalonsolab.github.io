In a synchronized multi-site evolution experiment, Wu et al. exposed Arabidopsis thaliana populations to diverse climates in outdoor environments, revealing rapid adaptation and extinction dynamics across environmental gradients. These results provide direct evidence of evolutionary responses under realistic climate conditions and highlight the potential for rapid genetic change or loss in the face of ongoing climate shifts.
